#### Setup
- Node.JS 14 ( or later )
- Install dependencies `yarn` or `npm i`
- `npm start` - Runs project.
- `npm test` - Runs tests.
- `npm run coverage` - Runs code coverage.
- You should have a MongoDB (You can config the DB URL in the "src/constant.ts" file)

Database filled with fake data

Routes:
[http://localhost:30100/api/sales/2021%20BMW%20X1](http://localhost:30100/api/sales/2021%20BMW%20X1)


#### Assumptions
- âœ… There is a lot of place for improvement. I wanted to put a reasonable time.
- âœ… This code is just a showcase, not perfect, not production ready!
- âœ… For shopping, I usually prefer relational DB. 

#### Todo
- ðŸ’¡ Improve Testing
- ðŸ’¡ https://swagger.io
- ðŸ’¡ Dictionary for Errors and more validation
- ðŸ’¡ Better modeling for database 
- ðŸ’¡ Throttle API requests, Pagination
